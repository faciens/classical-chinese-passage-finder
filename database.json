Looked at from the standpoint of affection, the former is father; from that of honour, he is ruler. If the son can give the affection due to the father, and the honour due to the ruler, hereafter he 'will (be fit to) be the lord of all under the sky. On this account the training of crown princes ought to be most carefully attended to. It is only in the case of the crown prince that by the doing of one thing three excellent things are realised; and it is with reference to his taking his place in the schools according to his age that this is spoken. Thus it is that when he takes his place in them in this way, the people observing it, one will say, 'He is to be our ruler, how is it that he gives place to us in the matter of years?' and it will be replied, 'While his father is alive, it is the rule that he should do so.' Thus all will understand the right course as between father and son. A second will make the same remark, and put the same question; and it will be replied, 'While the ruler is alive, it is the rule that he should do so;' and thus all will understand the righteousness that should obtain between ruler and minister. To a third putting the same question it will be said, 'He is giving to his elders what is due to their age;' and thus all will understand the observances that should rule between young and old. Therefore, while his father is alive, he is but a son; and, while his ruler is alive, he may be called merely a minister. Occupying aright the position of son and Minister is the way in which he shows the honour due to a ruler and the affection due to a father. He is thus taught the duties between father and son, between ruler and minister, between old and young; and when he has become master of all these, the state will be well governed. The saying, 'Music's Director the foundation lays; The Master this doth to perfection raise. Let him but once the great and good be taught, And all the states are to correctness brought,' finds its application in the case of the heir-son. So much for the duke of Zhou's going up by the eastern steps."],"「君子無所爭，":["\"The student of virtue has no contentions."],"必也射乎！":["If it be said he cannot avoid them, shall this be in

Pei Gong apologized: \"The general and I fought side by side against Qin. The general fought on the northern side of the (Yellow) river, and I fought on the south. I did not expect that I could be the first to break into Guanzhong and defeat Qin, and finally meet the general here.

King Xiang and Xiang Bo sat facing the east. Yafu sat facing the south. Yafu was namely Fan Zeng. Pei Gong sat facing the north. Zhang Liang sat beside (Pei Gong) facing the west. Fan Zeng glanced several times at King Xiang, holding the jade on his girdle to hint (that it was time to take action). King Xiang remained silence and did not react. Fan Zeng stood up, came out and found Xiang Zhuang, said to him: \"The Lord has not the heart (to kill). You should go in and toast, then ask to dance with a sword, and kill Pei Gong on his seat. Otherwise we all will be his prisoner one day.\" So Zhuang went in and toasted, then he said: \"The Lord drinks with Pei Gong, but there is no entertainment in the army, please allow me to dance with my sword.\" King Xiang said: \"Approved.\" Xiang Zhuang drew his sword and danced. Xiang Bo also drew his sword and danced along, protecting Pei Gong obscurely with his body. Zhuang had no chance. At this moment, Zhang Liang went out to the gate and found Fan Kuai. Fan Kuai asked: \"How is the situation?\" Liang said: \"Very dangerous! Xiang Zhuang is dancing with sword, intending to kill Pei Gong!\" Kuai said: \"This is urgent! Let me in, I will save him with my life.\" Kuai broke through the gate with shield and sword. The guards tried to stop him. He crashed the guards to the ground with his shield. Then he rushed in (to the hall), stood facing the west with the mantle on his shoulders, his eyes opening so wide that the brow ridge was about to break up. King Xiang touched his sword and asked: \"Who is this?\" Zhang Liang said: \"This is Pei Gong's stableman, Fan Kuai.\" King Xiang said: \"A hero! Bestow wine on him!\" Kuai was hence given wine. He (gave thanks) on his knees, then stood up and drank it all. King Xiang said: \"Bestow pork on him!\" He was then given raw pork. Kuai laid his shield on the ground, put the pork on it, cut the pork with his sword and ate. King Xiang asked: \"Hero! Can you drink again?\" Fan Kuai answered: \"Even death will not scare me, how would wine! The emperor of Qin was as cruel as tiger and wolf, killing and torturing the people without an end. So the people revolted against him. King Huai (of Chu) made the agreement with all lords that the first who broke into Guanzhong should be king. Since Pei Gong defeated Qin and took over the city of Xian Yang, he kept nothing for himself. He sealed the palace, and waited for the King's arrival. He ordered his men to guard the pass only to prevent bandits and emergencies. You did not award such a man of merit, but instead trusted lies and tricks, intending to kill him. This is the same behavior as the dead Qin. I suggest your highness not do this.\" The King did not answer him, instead he only said: \"Sit.\" Fan Kuai then took the seat beside Liang. After a while, Pei Gong got up and went out to the washroom, and asked Kuai to come with him."],"沛公已出，項王使都尉陳平召沛公。沛公曰：「今者出，未辭也，為之柰何？」樊噲曰：「大行不顧細謹，大禮不辭小讓。如今人方為刀俎，我為魚肉，何辭為。」於是遂去。乃令張良留謝。良問曰：「大王來何操？」曰：「我持白璧一雙，欲獻項王，玉斗一雙，欲與亞父，會其怒，不敢獻。公為我獻之」張良曰：「謹諾。」當是時，項王軍在鴻門下，沛公軍在霸上，相去四十里。沛公則置車騎，脫身獨騎，與樊噲、夏侯嬰、靳彊、紀信等四人持劍盾步走，從酈山下，道芷陽閒行。沛公謂張良曰：「從此道至吾軍，不過二十里耳。度我至軍中，公乃入。」沛公已去，閒至軍中，張良入謝，曰：「沛公不勝桮杓，不能辭。謹使臣良奉白璧一雙，再拜獻大王足下；玉斗一雙，再拜奉大將軍足下。」項王曰：「沛公安在？」良曰：「聞大王有意督過之，脫身獨去，已至軍矣。」項王則受璧，置之坐上。亞父受玉斗，置之地，拔劍撞而破之，曰：「唉！豎子不足與謀。奪項王天下者，必沛公也，吾屬今為之虜矣。」沛公至軍，立誅殺曹無傷。":["As Pei Gong has come out, King Xiang ordered Lieutenant Chen Ping to call him back in. Pei Gong said (to Fan Kuai): \"I came out without saying goodbye, what should I do now?\" Fan Kuai said: \"The most powerful never mind small matters; the most polite never care about small etiquette. Now they are knife and chopping block, we are fish in between, why need we say goodbye?\" So [Pei Gong decided to] leave. He ordered Zhang Liang to stay and apologize for him. Liang asked: \"Have you brought anything here?\" [Pei Gong] said: \"I have a pair of white jade for the Lord, and a pair of jade pecks for Yafu. They were angry so I dare not give them. Please deliver the gifts for me.\" Liang said: \"Yes.\" At that time, the camp of King Xiang was in Hongmen, and the camp of Pei Gong was in Bashang, 40 li from each other. Pei Gong discarded his chariot and rode alone, followed by Fan Kuai, Xiahou Ying, Qi Jiang and Ji Xin with swords and shields in their hands. They took a shortcut at the foot of the Mountain Li through Zhiyang. Pei Gong told Liang [before they left]: \"It is only 20 li to our camp through this path. You go back in when you estimate that we have arrived.\" Pei Gong reached his camp after a while. Zhang Liang went back in (to the hall) and apologized: \"Pei Gong has drunk too much, he cannot say his farewells. He ordered me to give this pair of white jade to the Lord, and this pair of jade pecks to the high general.\" King Xiang asked: \"Where is Pei Gong?\" Liang said: \"He heard that the Lord intended to blame him for his fault, so he left and should have arrived in his camp.\" King Xiang accepted the jade and put it on the table. Yafu took the jade pecks, put them on the ground and broke them with his sword, saying (to Xiang Yu): \"Ah! You idiot, I cannot help you! It shall be Pei Gong who will defeat you. We all will be imprisoned by him!\" Upon arriving in his camp, Pei Gong executed Cao Wushang."],"小取":["Minor Illustrations"],"大取":["Major
