A tool for finding bilingual Classical Chinese passages using a particular vocabulary

If you want to find some translated Classical Chinese/English passages that use your vocabulary, this is a tool to find them :)  

Just go here: https://faciens.github.io/classical-chinese-passage-finder/

Paste in all the characters you know, and it will search a corpus for passages that use only those characters and display them for you in a table (with links to the passage on https://ctext.org/ so you can see its context).

This is based on a cached set of passages from ctext.org.
