# classical-chinese-passage-finder

A tool for finding bilingual Classical Chinese passages using a particular vocabulary

If you want to find some translated Classical Chinese/English passages that use your vocabulary, this is a tool to find them :)  

Just go to the linked page:
paste in all the characters you know, and it will search a corpus for passages that use only those characters.

If you want to know more context, you can search for the passages/translations on ctext https://ctext.org/ :)
